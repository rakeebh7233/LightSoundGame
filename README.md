## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [x] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [x] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

  W3Schools for CSS reference

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

  A challenge I encountered in creating this submission is that I had trouble understanding the code, which made it difficult for me to do the  optional features.
  There was a big gap in time from when I implemented the required features to the optional features. Due to this week long gap, when I came back and looked at the
  code, none of it made sense to me. Furthermore, when I took a look at the sound sythesis functions, I became even more lost because after all I never used them
  before this project. To overcome this, I had to go through the prework required steps an additional time to refresh my memory of what the different functions
  did and the varables. This refresher helped me implement the speeding up and random pattern optional features soon after. Another challenge I encountered was trying
  to use CSS to make my website appealing. I am a very detail-oriented person and as a result, I am specific about how I wanted my website to look in terms of layout
  and colors. However, my CSS skills have depreciated after not touching web development in a while. As a result, I had to do a lot of research on CSS attributes to 
  create the webpage I envisioned for this project. Additionally, the colors were carefully selected to mesh well with each other and it was a challenge in picking 
  the colors I used.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
  
  A question that I have about web developent is how do I make web development, or more specifically, front-end development quicker. This isn't a question that only 
  occured to me while working on this project, but a question I always wondered in the few years of experience I had with basic web developmement. However, doing 
  this project made this question become more of a concern in my mind. I spent majority of my hours on my project just working on the front-end to make it look 
  somewhat palatable. This experience makes me wonder on how developers can make all these webpages and websites and meet deadlines. I know a possible answer to this
  problem would be front-end frameworks. However, in my limited experience with frameworks like BootStrap and some React, I still found front-end development to be
  a long process.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

  I would focus those few hours in adding more features to the game and expanding it. Firstly, I would finish all the optional features already mentioned. 
  If time permits, I would expand the game into multiple modes so that the user can play in different styles. One of the modes would be an endless mode. In this mode,
  there is no way to win and users will compete to get the highest score possible. I would add a normal mode, which would essentially be similar to the state of the
  current game, but users would get to choose the amount of lives they want. If I was to devote even more time, I would use a database like MongoDB and use NodeJS 
  to store users scores and add a webpage that tracks the highest scores around the world.
