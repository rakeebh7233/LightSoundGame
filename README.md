## Reflection Questions

  W3Schools for CSS reference

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

  A challenge I encountered in creating this submission is that I had trouble understanding the code, which made it difficult for me to do the  optional features.
  There was a big gap in time from when I implemented the required features to the optional features. Due to this week long gap, when I came back and looked at the
  code, none of it made sense to me. Furthermore, when I took a look at the sound sythesis functions, I became even more lost because after all I never used them
  before this project. To overcome this, I had to go through the prework required steps an additional time to refresh my memory of what the different functions
  did and the varables. This refresher helped me implement the speeding up and random pattern optional features soon after. Another challenge I encountered was trying
  to use CSS to make my website appealing. I am a very detail-oriented person and as a result, I am specific about how I wanted my website to look in terms of layout
  and colors. However, my CSS skills have depreciated after not touching web development in a while. As a result, I had to do a lot of research on CSS attributes to 
  create the webpage I envisioned for this project. Additionally, the colors were carefully selected to mesh well with each other and it was a challenge in picking 
  the colors I used.
